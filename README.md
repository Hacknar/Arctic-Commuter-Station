# Arctic Ariship Platform Enhanced
I made this mod as a challenge for myself inspired by the players asking for such a feature. Having said that, Im not even the kind of player that really enjoys this convenience, hahah, as I think its simplifies the game too much. But if you want it, more power to you.

Adds the worforce transfer mechanic to the arctic region via airship platform modules. Functions like the mail sorting office, its a module of the airship platform but also buildable standalone (necessary for the cliff islands). Also works with regular commuter piers which mods like the Spice it Up module/mod provides.

The buildings Model and texures were provided by Kurila, thanks!

Gave the commuter station a maintenance and influence cost (2000 and 30). Its double the commuter pier values.
